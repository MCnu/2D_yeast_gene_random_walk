# Yeast Chromatin Random Walk Dynamics
# 

A simulator for random walks of a chromatin molecule moving through the
 nucleus of a yeast cell.
 
 - `steps.py` contains `Stepper` classes which govern the random walks.
 - `trajectory.py` defines a `Trajectory` class which is generated by runs
  and which contain information about the motion of chromatin loci.
 - ` run.py` contains functions which generate trajectories.
