# Yeast Chromatin Random Walk Dynamics
# By Michael Chas Sumner and Steven B. Torrisi

A simulator for random walks of a chromatin molecule moving through the
 nucleus of a yeast cell. This is the full numerical / computational supplement to the
BioRxiv preprint (PREPRINT GOES HERE) by M. Sumner of the Brickner Group at Northwestern University.

Included within this repository are the functions used to generate the random walks used in the paper,
as well as scripts which were used to generate the data which went into the figures.


### Manuscript Scripts

(TO BE FILLED IN LATER.)

### Simulation Library 
 - `steps.py` contains `Stepper` classes which govern the random walks.
 - `trajectory.py` defines a `Trajectory` class which is generated by runs
  and which contain information about the motion of chromatin loci.
 - ` run.py` contains functions which generate trajectories.
